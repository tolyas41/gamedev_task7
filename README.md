Task 7. Files Sort


Use the matrix class developed earlier.

Create class hierarchies:

Class Loader, which provides a set of common methods for child classes:

ConsoleLoader – allows you to enter data for the matrix from the console

FileLoader – allows loading matrix data from a given file

Class Sorter, which provides a set of common methods for child classes:

QuickSort – implements quick sorting of matrix objects

UsualSort – implements usual sorting of matrix objects

Sort by the product of the sums of the elements on major and minor diagonals; in case of equality of this product, sort by the trace of the matrix.
